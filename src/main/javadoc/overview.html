<h3>OAuth 2.0 client / server SDK for Java with OpenID Connect 1.0 extensions</h3>

<h4>About OAuth 2.0</h4>

<p>OAuth 2.0 is an authorisation framework which enables a third-party
    application to obtain limited access to an HTTP service, either on
    behalf of a resource owner (the user), or by allowing the third-party
    application to obtain access on its own behalf.</p>

<p>OAuth 2.0 is specified in <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749">RFC 6749</a>
    and its companion specifications.</p>


<h4>About OpenID Connect 1.0</h4>

<p>OpenID Connect 1.0 is a simple identity layer on top of the OAuth 2.0
    protocol. It allows clients to verify the identity of the user based on the
    authentication performed by an authorisation server, as well as to obtain
    basic profile information about the user in an interoperable and REST-like
    manner.</p>

<p>OpenID Connect allows clients of all types, including Web-based, mobile, and
    JavaScript clients, to request and receive information about authenticated
    sessions and end-users. The specification suite is extensible, allowing
    optional encryption of identity data, discovery of OpenID Providers, and
    session management.</p>

    page</a> for more details.</p>
